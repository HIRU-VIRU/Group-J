# Cursor AI Instructions: M&A Due Diligence Agentic RAG Demo

## Project Overview
This is a Jupyter notebook demonstrating Agentic RAG for M&A Due Diligence analysis using Contextual AI's platform. The notebook includes:
- Document parsing and ingestion
- RAG agent creation with Grounded Language Model (GLM)
- Multi-document financial analysis
- Component demonstrations (Parser, Reranker, GLM, LMUnit)

## Critical Modification Required

### File Upload Cell Enhancement
**Location:** Step 3 - Document upload cell (search for `files_to_upload` variable)

**Current Behavior:**
- Downloads files from GitHub URLs directly
- No fallback mechanism if download fails

**Required Change:**
Modify the file upload cell to implement URL download with **automatic fallback to manual upload** if the URL fails.

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Try URL Download First**
   - Attempt to download from provided URL
   - Handle timeout errors (10 second timeout)
   - Handle HTTP errors (404, 500, etc.)
   - Handle network connection failures
   - Show clear status: "‚úì Successfully downloaded" or "‚úó Download failed"

2. **Fallback to Manual Upload**
   - If URL download fails for ANY reason, automatically trigger Google Colab file upload widget
   - Use `from google.colab import files` and `files.upload()`
   - Display clear prompt: "üìÅ Please upload {filename} manually:"
   - Move uploaded file to `data/` directory
   - Confirm successful manual upload

3. **Error Handling**
   - Wrap all download attempts in try-except blocks
   - Log specific error messages for debugging
   - Continue processing remaining files if one fails
   - Display final summary: "üìä Successfully processed X files"

4. **Preserve Existing Functionality**
   - Keep the datastore ingestion logic unchanged
   - Maintain the `document_ids` list tracking
   - Keep all print statements for progress tracking
   - Don't modify the Contextual AI API calls

### Files to Modify
- **Primary:** The cell containing `files_to_upload` list (currently around cell 15-20 in the notebook)
- **Variables to preserve:** `datastore_id`, `document_ids`, `files_to_upload`

### Testing Requirements
After implementation, verify:
1. Valid URL ‚Üí Downloads successfully
2. Invalid URL ‚Üí Triggers manual upload prompt
3. No URL provided ‚Üí Triggers manual upload prompt
4. All files successfully ingest to Contextual AI datastore
5. `document_ids` list populated correctly

## Existing Architecture (Do Not Modify)

### Components Used
- **Parser:** Contextual AI's multi-modal document parser (VLM + OCR)
- **Reranker:** Instruction-following reranker v2
- **GLM:** Grounded Language Model v1 (prevents hallucinations)
- **LMUnit:** Natural language unit testing for evaluation
- **Datastore:** ElasticSearch vector database

### Current Document Types
- Financial statements (10-K, quarterly reports)
- Legal contracts (acquisition agreements)
- Market analysis reports (industry research)

### Agent Configuration
The agent uses:
- System prompt defining role and guidelines
- Suggested queries for common use cases
- ElasticSearch datastore for retrieval
- GLM for grounded generation

## M&A Use Case Context
The demo is being adapted for M&A Due Diligence presentations focusing on:
- Debt structure risk assessment
- Regulatory compliance analysis
- Competitive positioning evaluation
- Synergy realization probability
- Multi-document financial synthesis

## Constraints
1. **Single-file notebook:** All changes must be in-notebook cells
2. **Colab environment:** Must work in Google Colab
3. **No breaking changes:** Existing cells must continue to work
4. **Manual upload compatibility:** Must support Colab's file upload widget
5. **URL flexibility:** Should handle both valid URLs and placeholder text

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use clear variable names matching existing conventions
- Include informative print statements with emoji indicators (‚úì, ‚úó, üìÅ, üìä)
- Handle exceptions gracefully with specific error messages
- Maintain consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Add comments for complex logic

## Implementation Notes
- The `requests` library is already imported in the notebook
- The `google.colab.files` module must be imported for manual upload
- File paths use `data/` directory convention
- Contextual AI client (`client`) is already initialized
- The `datastore_id` variable exists and is ready to use

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ URL download works when valid URL provided
‚úÖ Manual upload triggers automatically on URL failure
‚úÖ Clear user prompts and status messages displayed
‚úÖ All files successfully ingest to datastore
‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality
‚úÖ Robust error handling for all edge cases

## Additional Context
This modification enables seamless demo experience during hackathon presentations where:
- GitHub URLs might be rate-limited
- Network connectivity might be unreliable
- Presenters want flexibility to use local files
- Audience members want to try with their own documents

---

**Task:** Implement the file upload fallback mechanism in the document upload cell while preserving all existing functionality and following the requirements above.
