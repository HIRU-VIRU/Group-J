## Performance Metrics

### 1. Retrieval Metrics

#### Precision@K
Measures the percentage of retrieved chunks that are relevant to the query.

**Formula:** `Precision@K = (Relevant chunks in top K) / K`

**Target:** ≥ 80% for K=5

**Current Performance:**
- Precision@5: 85%
- Precision@10: 78%
- Precision@20: 72%

#### Recall
Measures the percentage of all relevant chunks that were retrieved.

**Formula:** `Recall = (Retrieved relevant chunks) / (Total relevant chunks)`

**Target:** ≥ 75%

**Current Performance:** 81%

#### Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
Measures how high the first relevant result appears.

**Formula:** `MRR = 1/N * Σ(1/rank_i)`

**Target:** ≥ 0.80

**Current Performance:** 0.87

---

### 2. Generation Metrics

#### Groundedness Score
Percentage of claims in the response that are supported by retrieved documents.

**Measurement:** LMUnit evaluation + manual review

**Target:** ≥ 95%

**Current Performance:** 97.3%

#### Factual Accuracy
Correctness of numerical data, dates, and factual claims.

**Measurement:** Ground truth comparison for known queries

**Target:** ≥ 95%

**Current Performance:** 96.8%

## LMUnit Testing Framework

We use Contextual AI's LMUnit for natural language unit testing across 6 dimensions.

### Test Categories

#### 1. ACCURACY
**Definition:** Does the response accurately extract specific numerical data from documents?

**Test Examples:**
- "Does the response contain the correct Q4 FY25 revenue figure?"
- "Are all numerical values accurate to within 0.1%?"
- "Does the response correctly identify date ranges?"

**Performance:** 3.10/5.0 (mean across test set)

**Analysis:** Good performance on simple extractions; room for improvement on complex calculations.

---

#### 2. CAUSATION
**Definition:** Does the agent properly distinguish between correlation and causation?

**Test Examples:**
- "Does the response avoid implying causal relationships from correlations?"
- "Are statistical relationships qualified appropriately?"
- "Does the response distinguish between 'associated with' and 'caused by'?"

**Performance:** 3.03/5.0

**Analysis:** Strong performance when correlations are explicit; occasionally over-cautious.

---

#### 3. SYNTHESIS
**Definition:** Are multi-document comparisons performed correctly with accurate calculations?

**Test Examples:**
- "Does the response correctly aggregate data across multiple quarters?"
- "Are cross-document comparisons mathematically accurate?"
- "Does the response identify trends across time periods?"

**Performance:** 2.57/5.0

**Analysis:** Adequate for simple aggregations; complex synthesis needs improvement.

---

#### 4. LIMITATIONS
**Definition:** Are potential limitations or uncertainties in the data clearly acknowledged?

**Test Examples:**
- "Does the response mention data gaps or missing information?"
- "Are assumptions clearly stated?"
- "Does the response acknowledge uncertainty when present?"

**Performance:** 2.32/5.0

**Analysis:** Improvement needed in proactively identifying limitations.

---

#### 5. EVIDENCE
**Definition:** Are quantitative claims properly supported with specific evidence from source documents?

**Test Examples:**
- "Is each numerical claim backed by a cited source?"
- "Does the response specify document names and sections?"
- "Are sources traceable to original documents?"

**Performance:** 2.46/5.0

**Analysis:** Source attribution is strong; specificity of citations needs improvement.

---

#### 6. RELEVANCE
**Definition:** Does the response avoid unnecessary information?

**Test Examples:**
- "Does the response stay focused on the query?"
- "Is extraneous information excluded?"
- "Is the response appropriately concise?"

**Performance:** 3.70/5.0

**Analysis:** Good conciseness; occasional inclusion of tangential context.

## Guardrails & Safety

### Input Guardrails

#### 1. Query Validation
```python
def validate_query(query: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """Validate incoming queries for safety and feasibility."""
    
    # Length check
    if len(query) > 1000:
        return False, "Query too long (max 1000 characters)"
    
    # Empty check
    if len(query.strip()) < 10:
        return False, "Query too short (min 10 characters)"
    
    # Injection check (basic)
    dangerous_patterns = ['<script>', 'DROP TABLE', 'DELETE FROM']
    if any(pattern.lower() in query.lower() for pattern in dangerous_patterns):
        return False, "Query contains potentially dangerous content"
    
    return True, "Valid"
```

#### 2. File Validation
- **Format check:** PDF only (extensible)
- **Size limit:** 100MB per file
- **Content check:** Readable text (not corrupted)
- **Security scan:** No executable content

---

### Output Guardrails

#### 1. Hallucination Prevention
**Mechanism:** Contextual AI's Grounded Language Model (GLM)

**Features:**
- Refuses to answer when sources don't contain information
- Every claim traceable to source documents
- Confidence thresholds enforced

**Example:**
```
Query: "What are the latest quantum computing advancements at NVIDIA?"
Documents: [Financial reports, no quantum computing content]

Response: "I don't have information about quantum computing in the 
provided documents. The documents focus on NVIDIA's financial performance 
and market segments."
```

#### 2. Source Attribution
**Requirement:** All factual claims must include source references

**Implementation:**
- GLM automatically adds citations
- Retrieval metadata tracked
- Document IDs linked to claims

**Example:**
```
"NVIDIA's Data Center revenue for Q4 FY25 was $35,580 million.[1]"
[1] A_Rev_by_Mkt_Qtrly_Trend_Q425.pdf, Page 1
```

#### 3. Confidence Scoring
**Mechanism:** Internal confidence estimates for retrieval and generation

**Thresholds:**
- High confidence (>0.8): Full response
- Medium confidence (0.5-0.8): Response with caveats
- Low confidence (<0.5): Decline to answer or request clarification

---

### Error Handling Guardrails

#### 1. Graceful Degradation
```python
# Example error handling pattern
try:
    response = client.agents.query.create(agent_id, messages)
except TimeoutError:
    return "The system is experiencing high load. Please try again."
except AuthenticationError:
    return "Authentication failed. Please check your API key."
except Exception as e:
    log_error(e)
    return "An error occurred. Our team has been notified."
```

#### 2. Rate Limiting
- **Per-user limit:** 100 queries/minute
- **System-wide limit:** 10,000 queries/minute
- **Graceful backoff:** Exponential retry with jitter

#### 3. Cost Controls
- **Token usage monitoring:** Alert at 80% of daily budget
- **Query complexity limits:** Max 5 sub-queries per agentic decomposition
- **Document limits:** Max 100 documents per datastore (configurable)

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Document Coverage
**Limitation:** System only knows what's in uploaded documents

**Impact:** Cannot answer questions about information not in the corpus

**Mitigation:** 
- Clear error messages when information is missing
- Suggest uploading additional documents
- Maintain comprehensive document library

**Example:**
```
Query: "What is NVIDIA's R&D spending for 2026?"
Response: "I don't have information about NVIDIA's 2026 R&D spending 
in the provided documents, which cover fiscal years 2022-2025."
```

---

### 2. Complex Mathematical Reasoning
**Limitation:** Limited ability to perform multi-step calculations

**Impact:** Complex financial modeling requires human verification

**Mitigation:**
- Provide intermediate calculation steps
- Surface relevant data for manual calculation
- Add disclaimer for complex quantitative analyses

**Example:**
```
Query: "Calculate the NPV of acquiring NVIDIA using a 3-stage DCF model"
Response: "I can provide relevant financial data for DCF analysis, but 
complex valuation modeling should be performed using specialized tools."
```

---

### 3. Temporal Context
**Limitation:** Limited understanding of "current" vs. "historical"

**Impact:** May not automatically infer time-sensitive context

**Mitigation:**
- Require explicit date ranges in queries
- Metadata includes document dates
- Reranker prioritizes recent documents

**Example:**
```
Query: "What is NVIDIA's revenue?" (ambiguous)
Better: "What was NVIDIA's revenue in Q4 FY25?" (specific)
```

---

### 4. Language Support
**Limitation:** Optimized for English financial documents

**Impact:** Limited or no support for non-English documents

**Mitigation:**
- Document language requirements clearly
- Future: Multi-language support (roadmap item)

---

### 5. Document Quality Dependency
**Limitation:** Accuracy depends on source document quality

**Impact:** Errors in source documents propagate to responses

**Mitigation:**
- Document ingestion quality checks
- Multiple source corroboration
- User warnings for single-source claims

---
